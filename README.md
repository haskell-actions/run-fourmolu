# Fourmolu action

![CI](https://github.com/haskell-actions/run-fourmolu/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

This `run-fourmolu` GitHub Action helps to ensure that your Haskell project is
formatted with [Fourmolu](https://github.com/fourmolu/fourmolu/). The action
tries to find all Haskell source code files in your repository and fails if any
of them are not formatted. In case of failure it prints the diff between the
actual contents of the file and its formatted version.

## Example usage

In the simple case all you need to do is to add this step to your job:

```yaml
- uses: haskell-actions/run-fourmolu@v9
  with:
    version: "0.13.0.0"
```

The `0.13.0.0` should be replaced with the version of Fourmolu you want to use.  See
[Fourmolu releases](https://github.com/fourmolu/fourmolu/releases) for all Fourmolu versions.
If you don't specify this Fourmolu `version` input, the latest version of
Fourmolu will be used.

The `@v9` after `haskell-actions/run-fourmolu` should be replaced with the version of the
`run-fourmolu` Action you want to use. See
[run-fourmolu releases](https://github.com/haskell-actions/run-fourmolu/releases) for all
run-fourmolu versions available.

## Example using latest version of Fourmolu

You can use the latest version of Fourmolu by specifying `version: "latest"`:

```yaml
- uses: haskell-actions/run-fourmolu@v9
  with:
    version: "latest"
```

Alternatively, if you leave out the `version` input, then `"latest"` will be assumed.

_It is recommended that users always specify the exact version of Fourmolu they
want to use, since new releases of Fourmolu are often not backwards compatible.
Your CI may break when there is a new release of Fourmolu._

### Full example

Here's a full YAML file you can copy and paste into your repo that runs
`run-fourmolu`. Add this as a file like `.github/workflows/fourmolu.yaml`.
This Workflow will run everytime you push to a branch.

```yaml
name: fourmolu
on: push
jobs:
  format:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Note that you must checkout your code before running haskell-actions/run-fourmolu
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: haskell-actions/run-fourmolu@v9
        with:
          version: "0.13.0.0"
```

### Example with more Options

Here's a more complicated example that shows more options being used:

```yaml
- uses: haskell-actions/run-fourmolu@v9
  with:
    # Use fourmolu-0.13.0.0.  If you don't specify this, then the latest
    # release of fourmolu will be used.
    version: "0.13.0.0"

    # Only check the format of .hs in the src/ directory
    # except src/Main.hs.
    pattern: |
      src/**/*.hs
      !src/Main.hs

    # Don't follow symbolic links to .hs files.
    follow-symbolic-links: false

    # Extra args to pass to fourmolu on the command line.
    extra-args: "--indent-wheres true"

    # Change to the ./my-haskell-code/ directory before running this action.
    working-directory: "./my-haskell-code"
```

See [docs](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob#patterns) on pattern syntax.

### Example usage with build matrix

If you are using a build matrix, then it is more efficient to have a
separate job for checking of formatting:

```yaml
jobs:
  fourmolu:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: haskell-actions/run-fourmolu@v9
        with:
          version: "0.13.0.0"
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: fourmolu
    ...
```

Here, the `build` job depends on the `fourmolu` job and will not run unless
the `fourmolu` job passes.

## Options

The available options are defined in [`./action.yml`](./action.yml). See that
file for more explanation.

<!-- run-fourmolu currently doesn't support running on Windows. -->
<!--

## Windows

If you are running a workflow on Windows, be wary of [Git's
`core.autocrlf`][git-core-autocrlf]. Fourmolu always converts CRLF endings to
LF endings which may result in spurious diffs, so you probably want to
disable `core.autocrlf`:

```shell
$ git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## Hacking on this repo

In order to do development on this repo, you first need to install NodeJS and
`npm` to your system. This has been confirmed to work with the following
versions, but newer (or slightly older) versions may work as well:

- **NodeJS**: v20.3.1
- **`npm`**: 9.6.7

Next, clone this repo:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:haskell-actions/run-fourmolu.git
```

Then, within this repo, install all dependencies defined in `package.json`:

```console
$ npm install
```

Now, you should be setup to start development. Development consists of hacking
on the [`./index.js`](./index.js) file. After making changes to this file,
you'll need to regenerate the files in [`./dist/`](./dist). You can do that
with the following command:

```console
$ npm run prepare
```

When sending a PR, make sure to run `npm run prepare` and commit the changes
to `./dist` whenever you make a change in `./index.js`.

## Making a new release

Do the following steps to make a new release:

1.  Add entries to [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for all changes since the
    last release.
2.  Manually create a GitHub release on
    <https://github.com/haskell-actions/run-fourmolu/releases/new>.
